# Atlanta Parks Weekly Report

This is an R Shiny app to reshape the Atlanta, GA [Office of Parks](https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/parks-recreation/office-of-parks). The Office of Parks produces a weekly report of reserved parks (called the [Weekly Report](https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/parks-recreation/office-of-parks/weekly-report)). While exhaustive, this report difficult to work with as individual reservations do not include the reservation date, forcing readers to flip back to identify the where the date is defined.
